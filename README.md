# pu-leaflet-maps

This Wordpress plugin adds a leaflet map to the post editor allowing users to drag and drop a marker to a location on the map that will be asscoiated with the blog post.

On the resulting post page, a map is inserted indicating the location on the map. A 'big map' shortcode is also included that generates a map displaying markers for all locations.

## Shortcode example

[puleaf-bigmap width='100%' height='600px']
